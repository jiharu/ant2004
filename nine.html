## New plan
### New goal
During the first part of the class, we have worked on drawing based on **observation** and working on freeing your hand. Now we are moving toward drawing as **expression** to express more of how you look and think. However this doesn't mean lesser importance of observation. Now we need to observe our target more wholeheartedly above its representational visual outlook alone.

#### How?
- Fondness and care of your object, yourself, and the world around.
- Conversation including a variety of questions.
- Specify your target.
- And draw & draw again.

### Final-term
- One or two good drawings of yours for an exhibition 
- Your presentation? 	
- Your (satisfied) drawing portfolio

### New addition to syllabus	
- Previous plan: perspective drawing, illustration, and self-expression.
- What we have missed: tones (shades) 
- New addition: more on human figures, animals, creatures, and layout. 
_____________________	
## Way to progress
- Let's draw continuously! - Try to draw everyday.
- Let's be inspired! - Drop by a drawing exhibition every week (this is Seoul!). 
________________
## Preparation of materials.
