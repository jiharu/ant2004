# Week eleven I: feedback and schedule.	
____________________
May 13 Wednesday

## Final-project
- **A drawing book** 
- Two presentations; one is about the process and the other is about the result **of making a drawing book**. 	
- A portfolio from the class
- and an exhibition at the final week

### Drawing book
- Theme 
	- As self-expression valued on **uniqueness, originality,** and **novelty.**  
	- As communication to target specific spectators and to deliver messages to them.	      
	- Now we need to think about ***how*** to achieve them.
- Length: 2 to 16 pages.    
- Size: about 15 * 21 cm.      
- Material/Medium: free.   
- Subject/Technique: free.     	
	
### Two presentations about making a drawing book

Length: 3 mins. You must submit the file as pdf before your presentation.        
Goal: Inspiring, and sharing information & opinions with each other.    

1. The first presentation is about your process: your plan including subject, motivation, references, color palette, your experimentation about materials and new expression, and finally your schedule.     
2. The second presentation is about the result: a short artist's statement, the final result, and crucial research means, materials and inspiration (influencing artists as an anchor to your art).

### Portfolio 
- Similar format as for the mid-term. It functions as a good record of your progress and achievements.

### Exhibition
- We will choose one among your achievements towards the drawing book or the portfolio.

## Anatomy study
### Structural similarities
The skeletons of turtles, horses, humans, birds, and bats are strikingly similar, in spite of the different ways of life of these animals and the diversity of their environments. The correspondence, bone by bone, can easily be seen not only in the limbs but also in every other part of the body. From a purely practical point of view, it is incomprehensible that a turtle should swim, a horse run, a person write, and a bird or a bat fly with forelimb structures built of the same bones. 

#### Homology: homologies of the forelimb among vertebrates

### Anatomy of horse

**The Anatomy of the Horse (Dover Anatomy for Artists)**      Paperback – June 1, 1976 by George Stubbs    
George Stubbs reveals himself as both a scientist and an artist in this detailed study of a dissection of a horse with his extraordinary skill and precision, as well as anatomical accuracy.       
Stubbs dissected a horse in a lonely Lincolnshire farmhouse to learn its anatomy in detail: the illustrations of his discoveries make him the Leonardo da Vinci of the equine kingdom. In this image the horse has been flayed, revealing the muscles and arteries within. Stubbs portrays it with an eerie mixture of clinical precision and statuesque dignity, giving it a grandeur in death even as he analyses it scientifically.

#### Story
Stubbs (1724 -1806) was born in Liverpool to a leather currier and merchant, and he followed in his father’s footsteps until he was about sixteen. Little is known about his life before age 35, but we do know that he briefly apprenticed for a Lancashire painter and engraver, but he found the work wasn’t to his liking, and so became a self-taught painter. Stubbs had always had an interest in anatomy, and in his early twenties he supported himself as a portrait artist while studying at a hospital in the North of England.    
Stubbs had long believed that “nature was and is always superior to art, whether Greek or Roman,” and after an extended trip to Italy, his suspicions were confirmed. He then devoted himself to painting natural beauty, and it was here that his passion for anatomy and art intersected. In the late 1750s he and his wife rented a farmhouse, and spent many months dissecting horses; during this time Stubbs also painted many horses for wealthy patrons. His clients were all of the opinion that his depictions of horses were much more realistic than those of previous artists, and soon his reputation as an equine authority was secure. [art.com]

#### Dissections
Stubbs took his knife and his pencil and physically climbed inside the horse, dissecting and drawing until he understood the mechanisms of its power and grace. Dissections were made over a total of 18 months. The entire project was developed over ten years. This is one of Stubbs' original finished pencil drawings, compressed from notes and observations. He translated his own drawings into engravings for publication.

## Practice & feedback
- Practice: draw anatomy of bison picture
________	
## Assignment (May 15)
- Keep making progress and bring your ideas/plans for the process presentation I.   
	- Mining for ideas; observe what you think about the most, what you feel the most, or/and what you look at or see the most. Is there anything you are responding to especially these days? Is it a form, texture, message, smell, or what?      
	After that, think and try to make the idea into a drawing. Don’t think about the quality at all at this stage. So far you have freed your hand, now it has become the time to free your mind and yourself gradually, and to express.   
- Complete anatomy of bison drawing and upload it to Tumblr.	
- Due by May 20th Wednesday.
