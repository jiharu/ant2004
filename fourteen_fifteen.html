# General information about the final project
## Final-project
- **A drawing book** 
- Two presentations; one is about the process and the other is about the result **of making a drawing book**. 	
- A portfolio from the class
- and an exhibition at the final week

### Drawing book
- Theme 
	- As self-expression valued on **uniqueness, originality,** and **novelty.**  
	- As communication to target specific spectators and to deliver messages to them.	      
	- Now we need to think about ***how*** to achieve them.
- Length: 2 to 16 pages.    
- Size: about 15 * 21 cm.      
- Material/Medium: free.   
- Subject/Technique: free.     	
	
### Two presentations about making a drawing book

Length: 3 mins. You must submit the file as pdf before your presentation.        
Goal: Inspiring, and sharing information & opinions with each other.    

1. The first presentation is about your process: your plan including subject, motivation, references, color palette, your experimentation about materials and new expression, and finally your schedule.     
2. The second presentation is about the result: a short artist's statement, the final result, and crucial research means, materials and inspiration (influencing artists as an anchor to your art)**: it substitutes the critique section of the exhibition.**

### Portfolio 
- Similar format as for the mid-term. It functions as a good record of your progress and achievements.

### Exhibition
- **Your drawing book along with a short artist presentation and optionally some of your achievements from the portfolio.**
