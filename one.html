## Week one: introduction 

### Goal
- Building fundamentals for the course
- Pre-instruction drawing   
- Freeing your hand

### Classroom layout
- X515: lectures / critique & discussion / table based hands-on practice.
- X517: Easel based hands-on practice + critique & discussion.

### Using the art studio
- Respect each other with quietness: **concentration -** drawing requires passion, and it is crucial to keep the class environment quiet. Concentration is directly related to the quality of your drawing result. A student who disturbs others may bear lower grades or even be expelled from classes.  
- Always tidy up after your use.

### Drawing materials  
- To be decided and announced in advance.

### The fundamentals
#### The goals of the class and discussion topics
- What is visual representation?
- Why is it fundamental to art and technology?
- How can we do evaluation; what is a good drawing?
- How can we draw?
- What is next?

### Hands-on practice
- "Pre-instruction drawings provide a valuable record of your drawing skills now, a record that will enable you to appreciate your advance in skills at a later date." - Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, B. Edwards

### Preparation for the next class, *Mar 4*
- Pencil (4B) 

### Learning the material
![pencilgrade](img/pencilgrade.jpg)   
European system uses a combination of numbers and the letters H (for Hard) and B (for Black). [link](http://www.museartanddesign.com/pencils-pencil-grades/)

---

### Preparation for the next class, *Mar 6*
- One drawing book (e.g., from Strathmore, or Canson. But if you like another for a reason, you can choose a different one.)
- Eraser
- Pencil sharpener

### Learning the material
#### Guide for the choice [link 1](http://www.museartanddesign.com/sketchbooks-surfaces-and-weights/), [link 2](http://www.thedrawingsource.com/drawing-paper.html):   

1. Size : A5 or B5

	![Papersize](img/papersize.jpg)

2. Surface: Roughness or "Tooth" in texture. Rougher surfaces are generally found more in thicker papers. Toothier papers are well suited to charcoal, crayon and pastels, ink washes and watercolor, or any work that utilizes the texture of the paper for aesthetic effect. Smoother surfaces take up less media and are better suited to more detailed work. 

3. Weight: 50-80 lb (approx 75-130 gsm)

#### The two sides of the paper 

**The top**: the felt side. This side faces up on the conveyor belt during production, gets the most attention, and is the side with the watermark when you buy a single sheet of paper. The grain of the paper is less noticeable on the felt side, so it is smoother.

**The bottom**: the wire side, because it faces down on a wire mesh screen during production.

_________________
## Freeing the hand
- Allow yourself the freedom to play; enjoy discovering what your hand and the material can do.
- Drawing is exploratory, and mistakes are a valuable process of learning. 

________________
## Physical characteristics of lines
[The article link](http://www.utdallas.edu/~melacy/pages/2D_Design/02_LineCharacteristics/PhysicalCharacteristicsofLine.pdf)

- Measure: the length and width of line – its measurable properties.
- Type: if the line continues in only one direction, it is straight;
if changes of direction gradually occur, it is curved; 
if those changes are sudden and abrupt, an angular line is created.
