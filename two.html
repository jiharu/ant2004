## Week two: dancing with ***lines*** 

### Goal
- Freeing your hand.
- Building sensibilities when using lines.
- Understanding how the expression of a line originates in the body.
- Braking or shaking habitual perception. 
__________
## Review

### Freeing the hand
- Allow yourself the freedom to play; enjoy discovering what your hand and the material can do.
- Drawing is exploratory, and mistakes are a valuable process of learning.

### Posture and grip

There are no rules as to how you should hold your drawing media. As long as your fingers, arm, and body are not restricted, hold your material as you find most comfortable, depending upon what it is and how large you are working.

#### Relaxed fingers
Hold the pencil away from its tip and relax your fingers. Use the side of your little fingernail as a support on the page. With your hand in this position, you can draw lines freely and achieve a significant arc of movement.

#### *Unfamiliarity*
The habitual movements of our handwriting style will sometimes infringe upon our drawing. To stop this, find an unfamiliar, alternative way of holding the pencil, or change to the wrong hand. This can give a new lease on life to your mark-making.

Various lines based on intensity of force and speed: 2 closed and 3 opened lines.

[Klee’s first rule of Bauhaus](http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/klees-first-rule-bauhaus-you-dont-get-bauhaus)   
#### Lesson one: lines
Klee’s famous opening line of his teaching book:   
**'An active line on a walk, moving freely, without goal…'**   
-> "it’s like knowing your hammer before you hit things with it.."

".. he’d visited Johannes Itten’s first year classes and seen him make the students do exercise to loosen up the body before drawing, and ask them to draw emotion rather than objects.."

### Assignments *Mar 11* : more practices on lines
1. Find three artists and find their drawings which emphasize lines. Analyze their lines and try to make their lines as yours. Use your sketchbook.
2. Try to explore practicing lines. (different closed and open lines)
3. Sign and date
4. Due by Mar 13 (It will be checked once you submit your sketchbook)

## Practice
#### 1, 2. *Instructions for the Vase/Faces drawing*
Time: each about 5 minutes

1. First, with your pencil, redraw the profile already printed on the page by going over the lines, starting at the top and naming the parts as your go: "Forehead... nose... upper lip... lower lip... chin... neck." Repeat, really thinking to yourself what those terms mean.  
2. Then, go to the other side and start drawing the missing profile that will complete the symmetrical vase in the center of the drawing.   
3. When you get somewhere between the forehead and the nose, you may begin to experience a sense of conflict or confusion. Try to continue drawing through this moment of conflict, self-observing as you draw: *How did you solve the problem?*

#### Two Ways of Knowing: L mode and R mode [link](http://www.drawright.com/theory.htm)

![brain](img/02/brain.jpg)

Betty Edwards has used the terms L-Mode and R-Mode to designate two ways of knowing and seeing - the verbal, analytic mode and the visual, perceptual mode - no matter where they are located in the individual brain. You are probably aware of these different characteristics. L-mode is a step-by-step style of thinking, using words, numbers and other symbols. L-mode strings things out in sequences, like words in a sentence. R-mode on the other hand, uses visual information and processes, not step-by-step, but all at once, like recognizing the face of a friend.

Most activities require both modes, each contributing its special functions, but a few activities require mainly one mode, without interference from the other. Drawing is one of these activities.

Learning to draw, then, turns out not to be "learning to draw." Paradoxically, "learning to draw" means learning to make a mental shift from L-mode to R-mode. That is what a person trained in drawing does, and that is what you can learn.

## Discussion about good drawing
There are lots of discussion points. These are the raw material for our further discussion. We will articulate more, and later, do some experimentations too.

Therefore, it is mandatory to read all for all. 
    
<!--
#### Subjectivity vs. Objectivity
About its value, its likeness

#### Artist's attitude
- Open mind
#### Artist's skill set
- Unlimited expression
#### Artist's own style
#### Drawing's message
- Give them questions, make them thinking, stimulating
#### Drawing's function
- Communication, Message in a form of stimulation, loved by its appreciators -->

## Practice
#### 1,2,3,4. *Instructions for the Upside-Down drawing*
Time: each about 15 minutes, so total will be 30 mins

1. Choose two drawings in orders out of four from which are given. They are printed upside-down. ***You will draw it upside-down too.***      
2. Once you have chosen two drawings, start with a simpler drawing and begin anywhere you like and start to copy the drawing you have chosen. Note: Take an advise that don't draw the whole outline. If there is any error in the outline, the parts will not fit together. This is quite frustrating to R-mode, which is specialized for perceiving how parts fit together.     
3. Moving from line to adjacent line, space to adjacent space, fit the parts together as you go. Try not to name parts as you are drawing. Draw the lines just as you see them, without trying to figure out what you are drawing. When you come to parts ***that seem to force their names on you-such as the hands and the face-***try to focus on those parts ***as just unnamed shapes.***   
4. Do not turn the drawing right side up until you have completely finished. Then turning it right side up. *What would you feel?*    
5. Sign and date your drawing and submit it. Don't forget to include the notation always used for a copied drawing: "After Picasso", "After Anonymous", or "After Schiele".
 

#### 5. *Instructions for pure contour (blind) drawing*   
Time: 15 minutes

1. Open your sketchbook.   
2. With your drawing hand holding the point of your pencil in the middle of your sketchbook page, ready to draw.   
3. Now, turn around i your seat so that you are facing in the opposite direction. Gaze at a single wrinkle in the palm of your non-drawing hand.   
4. Begin to draw that wrinkle, defined in drawing as an "edge." Move from wrinkle to wrinkle (edge to adjacent edge), confining your drawing to what you see in the center of your palm. Do not attempt to outline your whole hand, and do not turn to look at the drawing you are creating on the page.    
5. As your eyes very slowly track the edge of each tiny wrinkle in your palm, one millimeter at a time, your pencil will record your perceptions simultaneously. Your hand and pencil will function like a seismograph, recording every detail of what you are seeing.  
6. Continue to draw until the time is out. Then turn and look at your drawing.  
7. Sign and date your drawing.

With this practice, these component skills become integrated into a single, global skill, enabling you to draw whatever you see.

Russian painter, critic, and poet.

#### What drove Kandinsky to abstraction? [link](http://web.uam.es/otros/estetica/DOCUMENTOS%20EN%20PDF/SEGUNDA%20TANDA/NADIA%20PODMEZKAIA.PDF)

>"It was the hour when dusk draws in. I returned home with my
painting box having finished a study, still dreamy and absorbed in the
work I had completed, and suddenly saw an indescribably beautiful
picture, pervaded by an inner glow. At first, I stopped short and then
quickly approached this mysterious picture, on which I could discern only
forms and colors and whose content was incomprehensible. At once, I
discovered the key to the puzzle: it was a picture I had painted, standing
on its side against the wall. The next day, I tried to re-create my
impression of the picture from the previous evening by daylight. I only
half succeeded, however, even on its side, I constantly recognized objects,
and the fine bloom of dusk was missing. Now I could see clearly that
objects harmed my pictures."

K. Hall & Co, Vol. One (1901-1921), p. 369-370.

------
> "The summer of 1911, which was unusually hot for Germany, lasted desperately long…. Suddenly, all nature seemed to me white; white (great silence—full of possibilities) displayed itself everywhere and expanded visibly…. This discovery was of enormous importance for me. I felt, with an exactitude I had never yet experienced, that the principal tone, the innate inner character of color, can be redefined ad infinitum by its different uses…. This revelation turned the whole of painting upside-down and opened up before it a realm in which one had previously been unable to believe. I.e., the inner, thousandfold, unlimited values of one and the same quality, the possibility of obtaining and applying infinite series simply in combination with one single quality, tore open for me the gates of the realm of absolute art."

> Cologne Lecture, CW, 398.
