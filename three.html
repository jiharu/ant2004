### The basic component skills of drawing
- Edges
- Spaces
- Relationships
- Lights and shadows
- The *gestalt*
______________
### Sighting & Measuring
> Drawing or representing a three-dimensional form on a two-dimensional surface requires a language translation. the language of the first is different from the language of the second. 
One of the classical goal of the drawing is to observe the three-dimensional form and translate it on a two-dimensional surface.
> The process of sighting provides the method for making this translation easily and effectively.

#### Making sighting stick & viewfinder
- If the sighting stick is slender, it won't interfere with observing the form, however in the absence of a more suitable tool, a pencil will be an alternative.   
- Viewfinders are perceptual aids that will help you "frame" your view and compose your drawings.

## Space as the subject
In all pictures, spaces between things are as important as the things themselves.

### Negative spaces
>In drawing, negative spaces are real. They are not just "the empty parts".. negative spaces in drawings are just as solid, just as important as the positive forms. For the person just learning to draw, they are perhaps more important, because negative spaces make drawing difficult things easy.

### Shared edges
> The edges of the positive forms share edges with the negative spaces. If you draw one, you will have also drawn the other.

## Review II

## Review

- Post-exercise remarks.
- Sighting & measuring.
________________

### Preparation for the next class, *Mar 25*
- Use of easel, please sit by 9:00am on Weds.	
________________
### Assignments
- Making (or buying) and bring your viewfinder 

	![vf](img/03/viewf.jpg) 
	
	Note that the outside and inside edges of your viewfinders, and the format you draw on your drawing paper should have all the same proportion in width to length, differing only in size. Reference: Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards.    
	- size: similar or smaller size of your sketchbook.
	
- Complete your chair drawing.  	  
- Update your negative space drawings with your reference image (at least one) to Tumblr.
- Due date by Mar 24 Tue.	
________________
### Practice 
- **More on negative space drawings;** The first goal is to build the artistâ€™s habit of seeing positive and negative spaces simultaneously, naturally finding their shared edge. The second goal is getting used to perceiving the space of your paper, so that it becomes easy to locate your drawing in it with the right size and position.

- Drawing and evaluating.
- 10 to 15 mins of each practice. Please use guidelines as sighting & measuring.

## Discussion about good drawing
There are lots of discussion points. These are the raw material for our further discussion. We will articulate more, and later, do some experimentations too.

Therefore, it is mandatory to read all for all.
