## Week six: figure drawing.	
Reference: Drawing on the right side of the brain by Betty Edwards and more.  
____________________
Apr 8 Wednesday

## Goal

- Understanding the importances in drawing a human figure.
- Understanding poses and a brief overview of ancient art history and its theory
- Preparing gesture drawing
_________________
## Why human figure: the body

- Its intensive influence on the art field.
- This is what we are. It is the common thing we share with all other humans so it becomes a great communication medium to communicate with others.
- It is very familiar but has not been explored to exhaustion yet. 
- It is very difficult to draw for beginning art students.
- It is highly cultural as well as natural.
- It can be very personal but universal simultaneously.
- It is organic and highly complex and shows many study points of aesthetic principles.

## Theory
![davinci](img/06/Da_Vinci.jpg)  
Vitruvian Man, Leonardo da Vinci around 1490. 
 
It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the architect Vitruvius. The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the ***Canon of Proportions*** or, less often, ***Proportions of Man***. [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man)
 
### Contrapposto 
Contrapposto was an extremely important sculptural development for it is the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The balanced, harmonious pose of the Kritios Boy suggests a calm and relaxed state of mind, an evenness of temperament that is part of the ideal of man represented.

*Three Guards,*
1500-20, Raphael.

Italian High Renaissance painter: Raphael is best known for his images of the Madonna and Child, altar pieces, and Vatican frescos. He trained under Perugino, and studied to learn from the works of Michelangelo and Leonardo besides whom he was soon ranked. 

![ref02](img/06/matisse.jpg)   

*Blue Nude 1,*
1952, Henry Matisse.   

French painter, draftsman, printmaker, sculptor, designer, writer, teacher, and principal exponent of Fauvism-a movement established in 1905 in which bold color is the most essential element. Matisse became an artist after studying law. His calligraphic abstractions of natural form grew brighter, freer, and more energetic as his work matured.
