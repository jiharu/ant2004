Drawing is an art studio class in which students develop basic skills to convey and articulate complex and abstract ideas and personal expression in visual forms. Students will learn the theoretical and practical foundations of drawing as visual representation and communication through lectures, hands-on practice, and group critique. During the class, they will explore different materials, techniques, and themes, grounded in detailed observation and free imagination. For the final project, students will be encouraged to apply further contemporary experimentation responding to his/her own style and development.

-	Drawing as self-expression   
-	Drawing as a nonverbal language  

Students will build their drawing portfolio throughout the class.

### Prerequisites 

Concentration.

### Course format

This class takes a practice-based art studio format. Approximately half of the class will be hands-on practice by students (50%) alongside lectures conveying theory and practice (20%) with critique as discussed feedback (20%). There will be at least one exhibition of students’ projects (10%).  

Students will share their homework through the Tumblr website (http://2015ant2008.tumblr.com/). 

Questions and discussions are encouraged during the class time.

### Evaluation

1) Assignments to evaluate how students follow and develop each of the topics (30%).

3) Mid-term: one creative drawing project (20%).  
4) Final-term: one creative drawing project (20%).

### Course policies

1) Using the art studio; there will be strict rules for using the art studio, which will be announced during the first week of the semester.     
2) Attendance rule; this class will follow the general Sogang attendance rule, if you are not sure please check it from the Sogang website or from the class TA.   
3) Concentration; drawing requires passion, and it is crucial to keep the class environment quiet. Concentration is directly related to the quality of your drawing result. A student who disturbs others may bear lower grades or even be expelled from classes.    
4) Support for the disabled: seat support/ Extensions on homework’s and project submissions/ TA support etc.
